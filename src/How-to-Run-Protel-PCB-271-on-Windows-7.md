# How to Run Protel PCB 2.7.1 on Windows 7
 
Protel PCB 2.7.1 is a legacy software for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs) that was released in the late 1990s. It was later rebranded as Altium Designer, which is a modern and powerful PCB design tool for professional use[^1^]. However, some users may still prefer to use Protel PCB 2.7.1 for various reasons, such as familiarity, compatibility, or cost.

Unfortunately, Protel PCB 2.7.1 is not compatible with Windows 7, which is a newer operating system that has different system architecture and features than Windows XP, which Protel PCB 2.7.1 was designed for. If you try to run Protel PCB 2.7.1 on Windows 7, you may encounter various problems, such as corrupted buttons, missing DLL files, or crashes[^2^].
 
So how can you run Protel PCB 2.7.1 on Windows 7? There are two possible solutions: using a virtual machine or using a compatibility mode.
 
## Using a Virtual Machine
 
A virtual machine (VM) is a software that simulates a different operating system within your current one. For example, you can run Windows XP inside Windows 7 using a VM software such as VirtualBox or VMware. This way, you can install and run Protel PCB 2.7.1 on the virtual Windows XP without affecting your real Windows 7.
 
To use a VM, you need to have a copy of Windows XP installation disc or ISO file, as well as enough disk space and memory to allocate for the VM. You also need to install the VM software of your choice and follow its instructions to create a new virtual machine and install Windows XP on it. Once you have done that, you can install Protel PCB 2.7.1 on the virtual Windows XP and run it as usual.
 
The advantages of using a VM are that you can run Protel PCB 2.7.1 without any compatibility issues, and you can also access your files and data from both the virtual and the real operating systems. However, the disadvantages are that you need to have a valid license for Windows XP, and that running a VM may slow down your computer performance and consume more resources.
 
## Using a Compatibility Mode
 
A compatibility mode is a feature of Windows 7 that allows you to run older programs that were designed for previous versions of Windows. It does this by changing some settings and parameters of the program to make it more compatible with Windows 7. For example, it may change the screen resolution, color depth, or memory allocation of the program.
 
To use a compatibility mode, you need to right-click on the executable file of Protel PCB 2.7.1 (usually protelpcb.exe) and select Properties. Then go to the Compatibility tab and check the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" and choose Windows XP from the drop-down menu. You can also check other options such as "Run this program as an administrator" or "Disable visual themes" if needed. Then click OK and run the program normally.
 
The advantages of using a compatibility mode are that you don't need to have another copy of Windows XP or install any additional software, and that it does not affect your computer performance or resources as much as a VM does. However, the disadvantages are that it may not solve all the compatibility issues, and that some features or functions of Protel PCB 2.7.1 may not work properly or at all.
 
## Conclusion
 
In conclusion, Protel PCB 2.7.1 is an outdated software that is not compatible with Windows 7 by default. However, you can still run it on Windows 7 by using either a virtual machine or a compatibility mode, depending on your preferences and needs. Both methods have their pros and cons, so you should weigh them carefully before deciding which one to use.
 
If you want to upgrade your PCB design software to a more modern and powerful one, you should consider Altium Designer[^1^], which is the successor of Protel PCB
